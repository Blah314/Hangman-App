        <item>Welcome to Hang 10!\n\n
            This is unlike any other Hangman game you have ever played!\n\n
            If you have played Hangman before, this will be familiar and you should should have no problems figuring out the game. But even if you haven\'t, these help pages should tell you everything you need to know.</item>
        <item>The Basics\n\n
            Each game of Hang 10 consists of - well - 10 rounds of Hangman puzzles - each of increasing difficulty.\n\n
            The concept is simple - pick a category and you\'ll be given a phrase to guess. Guess letters by tapping on them and if they are in the phrase they are revealed. If not, you lose a life! :(\n\n
            You win each round by completely revealing the phrase. Win 10 rounds without losing all your lives and you win! </item>
        <item>Game Modes\n\n
		    Completing the game the first time round grants you access to new game modes to test yourself against.\n\n
		    Some game modes restrict your powerups, some have quirky new features and others are just plain difficult.\n\n
		    Can you conquer them all?</item>
    </string-array>
    
    <string name="fgDesc">The Free Guess: If you guess wrongly in your next turn, you won\'t lose a life!</string>
    <string name="leDesc">The Letter Eliminator: Eliminates five random letters not in the phrase from those that have not been guessed.</string>
    <string name="lrDesc">The Letter Reveal: Reveals a random letter in the phrase.</string>
    <string name="lsDesc">The Life Saver: Depending on how many of the letter you guess next are in the phrase, you will gain lives corressponding to that amount.</string>

        <item>That was almost too easy - right?</item>
        <item>Hopefully that wasn\'t too hard.</item>
        <item>Nice work! But there are harder modes to come...</item>
        <item>Big deal. Arguably Free Lunch is the easiest game mode.</item>

        <item>I have no words. That was very, very impressive.</item>
