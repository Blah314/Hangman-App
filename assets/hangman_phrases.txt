THE EARLY BIRD CATCHES THE WORM
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM
THE OPERA AIN'T OVER TILL THE FAT LADY SINGS
THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD
THE POT CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK
THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING
THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED
THE SALT OF THE EARTH
THE SHORT END OF THE STICK
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT
THE WRITING IS ON THE WALL
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO KILL A CAT
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH
THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX
THROW IN THE TOWEL
TILL THE COWS COME HOME
TIME AND TIDE WAIT FOR NO MAN
TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES
TO BE OR NOT TO BE, THAT IS THE QUESTION
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE
TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY
TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING
TRICK OR TREAT
